A work-in-progress **matching decompilation** of *Digimon World 2* for the Sony PlayStation.

The goal is to recover readable C that, when compiled with a period-correct toolchain,
produces a binary **byte-identical** to the original executable, then a moddable full-source
tree.

| Exe SHA-1 | `e55ed5bf354def07f0cbf4e1fb7fb5f99204f220` (651264 bytes) |
| Compiler | GCC 2.8.1 (PSX `cc1`) + maspsx |

## Status

Phase 0 is complete: the split relinks **byte-identical** to the retail executable, and the
text segment is compiled per-function so matching is underway. Each matched function is
verified by the full relink still producing `SLUS_011.93: OK` (SHA-1 match) - a scratch
match alone is never enough.

### Progress by component

DW2 is a single main executable with no overlays, so the main exe is the whole target for
now. As the text unit is split into per-file units, this table grows a row per unit.

Some functions cannot yet be reproduced byte-for-byte by the current toolchain (gp-relative
accesses under `-G0`, `$at` high-scratch stores, BIOS syscall thunks, and a handful of GCC
reassociation / delay-slot codegen choices); those keep their `INCLUDE_ASM` stub until the
toolchain covers them.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|------|------|
| `src/` / `include/` | decompiled C and headers |
| `configs/` | splat config + symbol maps |
| `tools/` | gcc-psx, maspsx, m2c, decomp-permuter, asm-differ, mkpsxiso, build scripts |

## Quick start

Supply your own Digimon World 2 (SLUS-01193) disc and extract `SLUS_011.93` to
`dumps/disc/`. Then:

```
python3 -m venv venv                                # venv\Scripts on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m splat split configs/USA/SLUS_011.93.yaml # regenerate asm/ and linkers/
python3 tools/build_dw2.py                          # expect: build/USA/out/SLUS_011.93: OK
```

`tools/build_dw2.py` preprocesses and compiles `src/**/*.c` through the PSX `cc1` + maspsx
pipeline, assembles the remaining split asm, links with the splat linker script plus the
auto-detected hardware and kernel symbols, then checks the SHA-1 against your disc's exe.
`build/USA/out/SLUS_011.93: OK` means the whole exe still reproduces byte-for-byte.

## Contributing a match

1. `python3 tools/score_functions.py --exhaustive asm/USA/main/nonmatchings` ranks the
   easiest unmatched functions.
2. Replace a function's `INCLUDE_ASM` in `src/main/156C.c` with C. Prefer proper structs
   over pointer arithmetic (`field_[offset]` names are fine) defined in the module header
   (see `include/main/156C.h`).
3. Verify with `python3 tools/build_dw2.py`. Only `SLUS_011.93: OK` counts as done.
4. One matched function is one commit.
